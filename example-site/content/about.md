# About

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

Lightning is a Hugo theme derived from [math-queiroz’s Rusty-Typewriter theme](https://github.com/math-queiroz).
It is designed to be clean and minimal, with a primary focus on blogging. The visual style draws inspiration from the current [Zen Browser website](https://zen-browser.app/), while its functionality is influenced by existing Hugo themes. Building on this foundation, the Lightning theme significantly extends the original with numerous design refinements and additional features.
These enhancements make Lightning suitable as a complete personal website, enabling individuals to publish blog posts, showcase projects, share social links, and present their résumé within a cohesive and modern layout.
